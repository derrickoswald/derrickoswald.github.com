                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    In many venues, such as hotels, airports, and conference centers,
                    one can connect to the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">Wifi</a>,
                    and yet cannot access the internet.
                    Even though you are given an IP address, to be able to browse or otherwise
                    exchange packets over TCP/IP you must first use a browser to login
                    using a supplied password or in some cases provide payment details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, without logging in it is often possible to bypass the paywall
                    using a subset of Internet Protocol (IP) called
                    Internet Control Message Protocol
                    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol">ICMP</a>),
                    or more specifically,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)">Ping</a>.
                    That is, you cannot exchange TCP/IP packets (browse), but you can use "ping" to
                    reach an external server - and it will reply back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the ability to pass packets it's possible to "tunnel" a connection "out of band".
                    The idea is not mine, I first saw the <a href="http://www.cs.uit.no/%7Edaniels/PingTunnel/">Ping Tunnel</a>
                    project many years ago. I'm not sure who thought of it first, but there are
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_tunnel">many implementations</a>.
                    Since first looking into the problem space, two issues have made it feasible
                    for me to attempt this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first breakthrough is the introduction of the
                    <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.
                    Now, instead of needing a large, power-sucking, always-on PC in order to provide
                    the necessary remote server, this inexpensive, power-frugal, wall wart
                    Linux server has all the necessary bits to do the server side task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other breakthrough, is the introduction of the
                    <a  href="http://golang.org">Go language</a>.
                    If you've ever programmed on Linux, you know that it is about
                    as much fun as poking a sharp stick in your eye - repeatedly.
                    Although Go is only moderately better than that, it offers two
                    compelling benefits:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        It is self contained and portable.
                        That is, if you can get Go running on your machine,
                        you have everything that is needed... mostly.<br>
                        It's like Java that way, in that the portability issues have been
                        abstracted out for you and you can assume that a binary
                        produced by Go will run without needing to upgrade every library or
                        recompile the kernel on the target machine.
                        This is especially important for execution
                        on the Raspberry Pi and Android phones where the
                        small size won't easily allow that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        It is built for networking. This is Google's language of choice for
                        new server installations and they know a bit about networking.
                        Go has a lot of libraries that support networking and
                        implementing this type of program is somewhat easier than
                        in C# or Java land.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the complete idea, is to run a supporting program on a Raspberry Pi, and
                    a client side proxy program on your PC or Android, so that you can browse
                    the web using any ICMP capable connection. Both programs would be written in Go.
