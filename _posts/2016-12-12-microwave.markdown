A few years back when we bought a new microwave, I was appalled at how much noise it made - beeping every time it was touched.

At the risk of being accused of endangering lives by posting this, to fix the microwave:

* Remove the 7 screws and remove the cover that has the silly label:

```Warning - Microwave energy - Do not remove this cover.```

* Cut the wire to the really annoying piezoelectric speaker - see illustration.
* Replace the cover and screws.

... enjoy the blissful silence.
