Hi.

Reading these posts won't make you any smarter. There are millions of other brighter people who have blogs that will do that.

These posts also won't give you any insight that you couldn't get from a myriad of other places, since I'm not a thought leader.

What I do hope to do, is give you something to think about, maybe entertain you, and possibly even make you laugh or cry.

I do this as an exercise for my own benefit mostly, and to provide a landing place for topics that I can refer to and
a way to provide references to others on things I may have explored first or deeper than they have.

Don't expect too much. We'll see how it goes.
